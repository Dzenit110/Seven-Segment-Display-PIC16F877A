## Seven-Segment-Display-PIC16F877A

Here are the tasks and smaller projects involving the 7-segment display. All three smaller tasks (projects) are briefly described.
## Microcontroller - 7 - Segment Display the digits from 0 to 9 and in reverse

This C and assembly code for a microcontroller enables displaying numbers on a 7-segment display. (Flowcode)
## Features

- **Initialization**: Configures necessary registers for operation.
- **Number Display**: Sets the initial value of `FCV_BROJ` to 0 and shows the current number on the display every second.
- **Counting Cycle**: When the number reaches 9, it decrements to 0, then increments again.

The program continuously repeats this process. An interrupt routine is defined but not implemented.

## 7-Segment Display Counter (0-9)

This C code for a microcontroller implements a simple counter displayed on a 7-segment display.

## Functionality

- **Initialization**: Configures the necessary registers and sets the initial value of the counter (`FCV_BROJAC`) to 0.
- **Infinite Loop**: Continuously displays the current value of the counter.
- **Counting Logic**: Increments the counter by 1 every second until it reaches 9, at which point it resets back to 0.

The program creates a simple up-counter that cycles between 0 and 9 on the 7-segment display.

## 7-Segment Display Up/Down Counter With Up and Down Buttons

This C code for a microcontroller implements an up/down counter displayed on a 7-segment display.

## Functionality

- **Initialization**: Sets the initial value of the counter (`FCV_BROJAC`) to 5 and configures button inputs for incrementing and decrementing the counter.
- **Infinite Loop**: Continuously checks the state of two buttons (Up and Down):
  - **Up Button**: Increments the counter by 1 each time the button is pressed, wrapping around to 0 when the counter exceeds 9.
  - **Down Button**: Decrements the counter by 1 each time the button is pressed, wrapping around to 9 when the counter reaches 0.
- **Display Update**: The current counter value is shown on the 7-segment display after each button press.

This program allows for interactive counting within the range of 0 to 9, controlled by user input.
